# Tools for writers

## Images

Please use only authorized images. For example, you can find many images in [cc search](https://search.creativecommons.org) website with [creative common licence](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/).

Do not forget to credit such image (if necessary) with `altimage` attribute.

## Content

You can use any text editor to write blog content, but dev tools provide useful plugins to make it easier, and to detect early typo, invalid spaces, etc.

## Markdown linter

- Visual Studio Code: [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

## Dictionary

Don't hesitate to install such tools to identify all mistakes (and quickly).

- Visual Studio Code: [French Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-french)
- JetBrains tools: new dictionaries can be added from `Preferences` > `Editor` > `Proofreading` > `Spelling`. You can find dictionaries [here](http://www.winedt.org/dict.html). [Hunspell](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2018/01/hunspell-dictionaries-support/) plugin also exists.

## whitespaces

These tools highlight many sorts of spaces (trailing spaces, unbreakable spacesâ€¦).

Remember that in french, we need to write unbreakable spaces before `;`, `?`, `!`, as well as for thousand separators, etc. This prevents unexpected line separators (before `:` for example).

- Visual Studio Code: [nbsp-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=possan.nbsp-vscode)
- JetBrains tools: see `Show whitespaces` in `Preferences` > `Editor` > `General` > `Appareance`. JetBrains tools also removes trailing spaces on save.

## Other

JetBrains tools offers a lot of spelling rules "for free" (see `Preferences` > `Editor` > `Proofreading` > `Grammar` > `Rules`).
