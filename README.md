## Motivation

In fact, this project is a classic use case for the [official vuepress blog plugin](https://github.com/ulivz/vuepress-plugin-blog). This project aims to minimize the cost of developing a vuepress blog theme, so that developers only care about the implementation of the theme style, without paying attention to the underlying details of the complex implementation.

All of following features are out-of-box:

- Blogging Convention
