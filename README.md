# 70-lines-of-vuepress-blog-theme

A VuePress Blog Theme implemented in around 70 lines.


## Motivation

In fact, this project is a classic use case for the [official vuepress blog plugin](https://github.com/ulivz/vuepress-plugin-blog). This project aims to minimize the cost of developing a vuepress blog theme, so that developers only care about the implementation of the theme style, without paying attention to the underlying details of the complex implementation.
