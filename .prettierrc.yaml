# Print trailing commas wherever possible when multi-line. (A single-line array,

# Include parentheses around a sole arrow function parameter.
#     "always" - Always include parens. Example: (x) => x
# At first glance, avoiding parentheses may look like a better choice because of
# less visual noise. However, when Prettier removes parentheses, it becomes
# harder to add type annotations, extra arguments or default values as well as
# making other changes. Consistent use of parentheses provides a better
# developer experience when editing real codebases, which justifies the default
# value for the option.
arrowParens: 'always'
